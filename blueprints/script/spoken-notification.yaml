    # Spoken Notification
    
    This blueprint script makes spoken announcements using text-to-speech (TTS) and an 
    optonal alert sound.
    voice announcements on or off. This is useful, when you  want to silence the spoken alert automations 
    automatically, for example during night time. With the Alert sound switch you can select an optional 
    sound to be played, before the spoken announcement starts.
